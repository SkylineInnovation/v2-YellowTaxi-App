## Current Issue: Firestore Index Error
**Error**: "Error subscribing to ride requests: Error: [firestore/failed-precondition] The query requires an index."

**Analysis**:
- The error occurs in rideService.ts at line 207:24
- Query combines `where('customerId', '==', customerId)` with `orderBy('createdAt', 'desc')`
- Firestore requires a composite index for queries with where + orderBy on different fields

**Solution Plan**:
- [x] Create firestore.indexes.json configuration file
- [x] Define composite index for ride-requests collection
- [x] Create firebase.json for project configuration
- [x] Create firestore.rules for security rules
- [x] Open Firebase Console to create the index
- [x] Commit and push all Firebase configuration files
- [ ] Deploy index to Firebase console or use Firebase CLI
- [ ] Test the fix by running the app

**‚úÖ COMMITTED SUCCESSFULLY**:
- **Commit**: `7e67dd5` - feat: Add Firestore configuration and fix composite index error
- **Files Added**: firebase.json, firestore.indexes.json, firestore.rules
- **Files Modified**: .gitignore, scratchpad.md
- **Status**: Pushed to origin/main

**Files Created**:
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Defines composite indexes for ride-requests and orders collections
- `firebase.json` - Firebase project configuration
- `firestore.rules` - Security rules for Firestore collections

**Next Steps**:
1. **Firebase Console** (EASIEST): The browser has opened to the exact URL to create the index. Click "Create Index" button.
2. **Firebase CLI** (ALTERNATIVE): Run `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes` if you have Firebase CLI installed.

**Index Details**:
- **Collection**: ride-requests
- **Fields**: customerId (ASC) + createdAt (DESC)
- **Purpose**: Enables queries that filter by customerId and order by createdAt

### Service Icons UI Implementation ‚úÖ

- [x] Integrate proper navigation handling (Ride Order working, others show 'Coming Soon')
- [x] Apply YellowTaxi branding with primary colors and consistent design
- [x] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [x] Commit changes and create pull request (#4)

**Professional Service Icons Grid Achieved:**
The YellowTaxi welcome screen now features a modern, visually appealing service icons grid that replaces the previous action cards. Users can easily discover and navigate to available services with clear visual hierarchy and professional design consistency.

**Technical Implementation:**
